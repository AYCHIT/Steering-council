# Standing Delegations

This document serves as a public record of current standing delegations, the
reasons they were put in place, and the circumstances under which they may no
longer be needed.

Currently active packaging interoperability specifications are maintained in
the [PyPA Specifications] section in the Python Packaging User Guide and the
process for updating those specifications is documented in the [PyPA
Documentation].

These delegations are expected to stand indefinitely.
